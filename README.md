# Chi-Chi Says

## Game

* I created this game, which has the same premise as Simon Says. Instead of the traditional game layout, I incorporated one of my favorite TV shows Dragon Ball Z. 

* Two players will face off and see who can remember as many color sequences. Who will become the strongest character of them all with power levels over 9000?

* Your mind will be tested and we'll see who comes out as the champion of the ring. 

* Rules are simple and straight forward. Remember more color sequences than your opponent. Your mind depends on it.

* Controls are simple too. When the game displays the various colors, click the color in the ordered it was presented. 

* To build this game I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery. I incorporated Animate.css, normalize.css, jQuery library, and fonts from Google Fonts.

* Backlog: The most pressing issue I faced was figuring out the logic side of the game and ensuring it would switch off to the second player properly.
